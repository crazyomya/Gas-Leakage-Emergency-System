In todayâ€™s world automated devices are getting attention from almost all people. At the same time, they are concerned about their own safety as well. Gas leakage emergency system is an attempt in providing both at the same time. It is a system that reduces the chances of fatalities due to leakage of flammable and other harmful gases. It helps in avoiding fire accidents as well. When an emergency related to gas leakage arises, a gas sensor detects it and actuates the system device. Later, the buzzer and emergency lights turn on immediately alerting people in the room about the emergency. Also, an automatic emergency door opens for people to get out of the room. To prevent the situation from getting worse, the system turns on an exhaust fan to flush the harmful gas out of the room thus reducing the concentration of the harmful gas. At the same with the use of IoT, a notification is sent to the concerned authorities informing them about the emergency. This is an important feature as it provides a remote alert to the user.
