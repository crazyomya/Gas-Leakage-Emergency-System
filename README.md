# Gas Leakage Emergency System

In our increasingly automated world, safety is a paramount concern. The Gas Leakage Emergency System is a solution that addresses this concern while ensuring safety. This system is designed to reduce the risk of fatalities caused by the leakage of flammable and harmful gases while also helping to prevent fire accidents.

## Key Features

- **Gas Detection**: The system is equipped with gas sensors that can detect the presence of harmful gases in the environment.

- **Immediate Alerting**: When a gas leakage emergency occurs, the system takes swift action. It activates alarms, including a buzzer and emergency lights, to alert individuals in the vicinity about the emergency.

- **Safe Exit**: An automatic emergency door is triggered to open, providing a safe and swift exit for people in the affected area.

- **Gas Ventilation**: To mitigate the situation, an exhaust fan is activated to expel harmful gases from the room, reducing their concentration.

- **IoT Integration**: Leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT), the system sends notifications to relevant authorities, keeping them informed about the emergency in real-time.

This system serves as a crucial safety measure by promptly detecting gas leaks, alerting occupants, and taking steps to ensure their safety. Additionally, it provides remote alerts to authorities, enhancing overall safety and response effectiveness.
